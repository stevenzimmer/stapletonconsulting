				<h2 class="mb40">About Michael Stapleton, CEO &amp; Founder</h2>
				<p class="mb20">
					Michael Stapleton is the Founder and CEO of Stapleton Consulting. He started the firm when he saw: 1) How many companies focused their marketing on promotional activities without really understanding their go-to-market strategy, and 2) How many agencies were set up to support those promotional activities. Stapleton Consulting was founded on the belief that demand generation becomes simple when you have a strong foundational strategy in place.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before founding Stapleton Consulting, Michael was the VP of Marketing at Fond (formerly AnyPerk), where he was responsible for shaping go-to-market strategy, building brand awareness, and driving growth. Prior to Fond, he was the VP of Marketing at Gild (acquired by Citadel). Michael graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Reed College with a B.A. in English. An active alumnus, he leads alumni development for the college as chair of Alumni Fundraising for Reed.
